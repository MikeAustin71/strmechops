# Release Notes For Package ***strmech*** - String Mechanics

## Version 0.0.1

#### Changes

This is the first release of ***strmech***, a collection of string management tools designed for use in ***Go*** programs.

This is a staging release intended to coordinate documentation links and perform testing on virtual machines running different operating systems.

This code was imported from [stringsopsgo](https://github.com/MikeAustin71/stringopsgo) Version 3.0.0. The ***stringsopsgo*** repository has been deprecated and all related development efforts have been folded into ***strmech***.

Feature changes added to the original ***stringopsgo*** code base include:

- Developed with  [**Go**](https://golang.org/) Version 1.16.3.
- Thread Safety protocols added for improved concurrency support.
- Enhanced error management capabilities added including support for attaching error prefix text to error messages. 
- Full support for [Go Modules](https://golang.org/ref/mod).
