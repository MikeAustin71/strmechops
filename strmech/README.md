# *strmech* - String Mechanics

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/MikeAustin71/strmech?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/MikeAustin71/strmech)

[**strmech**](https://github.com/MikeAustin71/strmech) is a software package containing a collection of string management utilities written in the [**Go**](https://golang.org/) Programming Language. 

***strmech*** provides simple string management routines which perform operations like string formatting, centering, justification trimming, numeric digit extraction and character manipulation. 

Version 0.0.1 represents the first release of ***strmech*** which incorporates code imported from Version 3.0 of [stringsopsgo](https://github.com/MikeAustin71/stringopsgo). The [stringsopsgo](https://github.com/MikeAustin71/stringopsgo) project has been deprecated and all future development of this string management toolbox will focus on the ***strmech*** package.

Version 0.0.1 is a staging release designed to coordinate and verify documentation links and provide an initial release for testing on virtual machines running various operating systems. The first public release is planned for Version 0.1.0 which should be completed in the near future.



## Key Features  

- Developed with  [**Go**](https://golang.org/) Version 1.16.3.
- Thread Safety protocols added for improved concurrency support.
- Enhanced error management capabilities added including support for attaching error prefix text to error messages. 
- Full support for [Go Modules](https://golang.org/ref/mod).
- For feature details, see the [Source Code Documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/MikeAustin71/strmech).
