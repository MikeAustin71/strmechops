# Running Tests StrOps

Open a command prompt in this directory (*strmech*) and run the
following commands.

## Test Execution WITHOUT Code Coverage
Run this in *strmech* directory:

### Windows Command Without Coverage
  `go test -v > zzzzz_tests.txt`

### Linux Command Without Coverage
`go test -v | tee zzzzz_tests.txt`

directory which are stored in the text file, `zzzzz_tests.txt`.
