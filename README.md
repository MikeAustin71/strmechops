# strmechops - String Mechanics Operations
This is the development environment for the [**Go**](https://golang.org/) software package, [***strmech***]([MikeAustin71/strmech: A collection of string management tools for Go Programming (github.com)](https://github.com/MikeAustin71/strmech)).

String Mechanics is a collection of string management tools designed for use in [**Go**](https://golang.org/) programs. The coded was originally imported from my [stringsopsgo](https://github.com/MikeAustin71/stringopsgo) repository using Version 3.0. The original **stringopsgo** repository is now deprecated and all future development efforts will focus on the [***strmech***](https://github.com/MikeAustin71/strmech) project.
