# strmechops - String Mechanics Operations
This is the development environment for the [**Go**](https://golang.org/) software package, [***strmech***](https://github.com/MikeAustin71/strmech).

String Mechanics is a collection of string management tools designed for use in [**Go**](https://golang.org/) programs. This code was originally imported from my [stringsopsgo](https://github.com/MikeAustin71/stringopsgo) repository, Version 3.0. The original **stringopsgo** repository is now deprecated and all future development efforts will focus on the [***strmech***](https://github.com/MikeAustin71/strmech) project. 

While all development work will take place in this repository, [***strmechops***](https://github.com/MikeAustin71/strmechops), the release versions of this software package will be stored and distributed from the  [***strmech***](https://github.com/MikeAustin71/strmech) repository.
