When some words are missing in the pre-defined dictionaries, you
can create your own. A custom dictionary is a .dic text file
containing each word on a new line.

To add new directories, open settings by pressing Ctrl+Alt+S and
navigate to Editor | Natural Languages | Spelling.


GoLand includes a built-in IDE Features Trainer. It
provides interactive training courses to help you
learn how to do some common tasks, such as refactoring
code, navigating through projects, debugging, and working
with version control.

Make sure the IDE Features Trainer plugin is enabled
in the Installed tab of the Plugins page in the IDE
settings.

To open the Learn tool window and start your exercises,
select View | Tool Windows | Learn or Help | Learn IDE Features from the main menu. The tool window lists the available tutorials.
